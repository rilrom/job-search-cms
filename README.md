# Job Search CMS

Payload CMS for job search front end.

## Project Status

This project is currently in development. Admins can currently add, edit or remove jobs which are then available through an API. Additional jobs fields and job search pages will be added in the future.

## Reflection

I was looking to move on from headless drupal and look for a solution easier to setup and more suitable for small projects. A few trial and errors led me to [Payload CMS ](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload) which is perfect for my needs.

I have only just dipped my toes in Payload CMS so I'm looking forward to extending my knowledge and taking advantage of its versatility for my upcoming projects.
